## Detailed Description

🦠 The Parasite — Your Friendly Digital Parasite

Do you know how many YouTube Shorts you've watched today?

The Parasite tracks your YouTube Shorts consumption in real-time and progressively locks your screen when you binge — forcing you to take a break.

✅ Features:
• Real-time Shorts counter displayed on screen
• Cumulative watch time tracking
• Progressive screen lockdown every 10 Shorts (30s → 1min → 2min → ... up to 4 hours)
• Auto-pauses video during lockdown
• Blocks all clicks and scrolling during lockdown
• Warning color changes (green → yellow → red) as you watch more

🔒 Privacy First:
• Zero data collection. Zero server communication.
• All data stored locally on your device only.
• No third-party services. No analytics. No tracking.

💡 Why "Parasite"?
Other apps BLOCK websites. The Parasite doesn't block anything.
Instead, it lives INSIDE the apps you use, making you AWARE of your unconscious consumption.
It's not a notification. It's already on your screen.

🎯 Lockdown Schedule:
10 Shorts → 30s | 20 → 1min | 30 → 2min | 40 → 4min
50 → 8min | 60 → 16min | 70 → 32min | 80 → 1hr
90 → 2hr | 100 → 4hr+

Watch 100 Shorts and you lose YouTube for 4 hours.
That's the point.

Made with 🦠 by a human who watched too many shorts.
