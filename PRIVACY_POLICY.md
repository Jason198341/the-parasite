# Privacy Policy — The Parasite

**Last updated: February 7, 2026**

## Summary
The Parasite does NOT collect, transmit, or share any user data. Period.

## Data Collection
- **We collect nothing.** Zero. No analytics, no tracking, no telemetry.
- All data (shorts count, watch time) is stored **locally on your device** using Chrome's `chrome.storage.local` API.
- No data ever leaves your browser.

## Data Storage
- All data is stored locally in your browser's extension storage.
- You can clear all data by removing the extension.
- No cookies are used.
- No external servers are contacted.

## Third-Party Services
- The Parasite does **not** use any third-party services, APIs, or analytics platforms.
- No data is shared with any third party.

## Permissions Explained
- **storage**: To save your settings and counter data locally on your device.
- **Content script on youtube.com**: To display the shorts counter and lockdown overlay on YouTube pages. The extension only reads the current URL to detect shorts navigation — it does not read or modify any of your personal YouTube data.

## Children's Privacy
This extension does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes
If we update this policy, the updated version will be included with the extension update.

**tl;dr: We don't collect your data. Everything stays on your device. That's the whole point — your parasite works for YOU, not for us.**
